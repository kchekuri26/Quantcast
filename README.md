# Most Active Cookie

### How to Execute:

1. Navigate to the repository directory.

2. Add the `<fileName>.csv` file, which has similar format to [test.csv](https://github.com/kchekuri26/Quantcast/blob/main/test.csv) to the directory.

3. Make sure to install latest version of **Java** if not already installed.

4. Run the following command `$ java -jar MostActiveCookie.jar <fileName>.csv -d YYYY-MM-DD` or else use `test.csv` in place of `<fileName>.csv` to see how the program works.

### Testing:

I have used [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to test my program. The tests can be found [here](https://github.com/kchekuri26/Quantcast/tree/main/src/test/java).
